The Message-ID format is specified in RFC 5322, 
3.6.4 "Identification Fields". This email's Message-ID is invalid -
the square brackets are not allowed at this point. This could be valid:

Message-ID: <myid@[d7c5838b5ab944f89e3f0c1b85674aef====@example.com]>

So maybe there was an ID that was omitted...
